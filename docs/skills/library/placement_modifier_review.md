## SOP
- Review placement modifiers with matching placement performance (spend, sales, ACOS/ROAS).
- Prioritize placements with consistent data coverage over one-day spikes.
- Change modifiers in bounded increments and log rationale.

## Why
Placement multipliers can move spend distribution quickly; they should track measured efficiency, not intuition.

## Risks
- Overspending weak placements due to recency bias.
- Underfunding profitable placements from incomplete windows.
- Confounded evaluations when large modifier jumps happen mid-window.
