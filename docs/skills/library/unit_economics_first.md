## SOP
- Start every recommendation with profit path: margin, TACOS, and contribution trend.
- Reject growth actions that worsen unit economics without a bounded test hypothesis.
- Separate traffic growth ideas from profitability recovery tasks.

## Why
Volume without healthy unit economics compounds losses and masks operational problems.

## Risks
- Scaling unprofitable demand.
- Misreading revenue growth as business improvement.
- Delayed corrective action on cost leaks.
