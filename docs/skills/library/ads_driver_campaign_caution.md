## SOP
- Treat identified driver campaigns as high-risk assets.
- Require explicit evidence before changing budget, bids, or targeting breadth.
- Prefer narrow, reversible adjustments over broad structural edits.

## Why
Driver campaigns can carry most attributed revenue. Large, fast edits can break baseline comparability and create avoidable volatility.

## Risks
- Sales drop from over-correction.
- Attribution noise that hides real experiment signal.
- Rollback burden if multiple high-impact fields are changed at once.
